       <p style="color:black"> How much does an interior designer cost? If you’re in the market for
         finding an interior designer, you’ll see prices and services vary quite a bit,
          depending on the designer and their cost structure. Whether they charge an 
          hourly or flat rate, interior designers exercise a variety of ways to figure 
          out their prices. Some take into account project size while others charge a commission
           percentage on the total cost.<br> Regardless, being informed of the options is a good place to start.
           On average, a typical interior designer will cost anywhere from $2,000 all the way up to $12,000,
            excluding furniture. Fortunately, new alternatives like online interior design services can 
            help you save $1,000s! Online interior designer service costs range from $79 to $1849 and the 
            interior design fees are typically flat.<br> Starting a project online is a budget savvy way to
             connect with professional interior designers in a quick and easy way. The benefit of online 
             interior design is that you can work on your own schedule and preview how everything will look
